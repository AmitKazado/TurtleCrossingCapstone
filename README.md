# Turtle Crossing Game

## Game Objective:
Help the Turtle cross the street onto the finish line without bumping into a Car (Cars are shown as colored rectangulars in this case).

## Game Rules & Mechanics:
Leveling up - occurs upon reaching the finish line, the Turtle will be positioned back at the starting point and have his level increased along with higher difficulty (higher difficulty meaning the Cars will move faster).

Moving the Turtle will be done with the "Up" arrow key.

Game Over - the game is finished if the Turtle has hit a Car.
